## Analysing daily power usage data for my house

Ever since my landlord installed a power meter in my studio unit, I have been recording daily usage on a Google docs spreadsheet. This is the code I use to check usage stats and compare usage patterns with weather data.

## Data
Daily readings from power meter was entered into a Google docs spreadsheet (Google Sheets). There are two dates with no data due to blackout. Past weather data was obtained using weatherData R package. Sign-in using a Google account is required to access Google docs spreadsheet.

## R packages used
* tidyverse
* googlesheets
* weatherData
